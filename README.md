# Vbox Playlist Downloader

A simple tool which downloads all videos from a Vbox playlist. You pass the link and the magic happens. The downloaded files are saved in the /downloads folder of the project.

# Running the project

If you will use docker run "docker compose up" in the root of the project and it would run the example.php, otherwise you should install ffmpeg manually (https://www.ffmpeg.org/)

Please check the example.php to see how the tool should be used : )
